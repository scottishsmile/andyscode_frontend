            <p>Any notice or other communication to be given hereunder will be in writing and given by registered or certified mail return receipt requested, or email (by us to the email associated with your account or by you to {TERMS_PRIVACY_EMAIL} ).</p>
            <br />
            <h4>9.7 Relationship Between Us</h4>
            <p>You and we agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, contractor, or agency relationship exists between us.</p>
            <br />
            <h4>9.8 No Assignment</h4>
            <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms (or the rights and licenses granted under them). For example, if you registered an account as an employee of a company, your account cannot be transferred to another employee.</p>
            <p>We may assign these Terms (or the rights and licenses granted under them) to another company or person without restriction.</p>
            <p>We may assign these Terms (or the rights and licenses granted under them) to another company or person without restriction.</p>
            <p>You agree that your account is non-transferable and that all rights to your account and other rights under these Terms terminate upon your death.</p>
            <br />
            <h4>10. Dispute Resolution</h4>
            <p>Please raise a support ticket for any disputes so we can try and resolve them.</p>
            <p>If that is unsatisfactory, you can go to Western Australia's small claims court or bring a claim in arbitration, you may not bring that claim in another court or participate in a non-individual class action claim against us.</p>
            <br />
            <h4>10.1 No Class Actions</h4>
            <p>We both agree that we can each only bring claims against the other on an individual basis.</p>
            <p>This means: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Neither of us can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action</li>
                <li>An arbitrator can’t combine multiple people’s claims into a single case (or preside over any consolidated, class, or representative action)</li>
                <li>An arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s case can only impact that user, not other users, and can’t be used to decide other users’ disputes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If a court decides that this “No class actions” clause isn’t enforceable or valid, then this “Dispute Resolution” section will be null and void, but the rest of the Terms and Conditions will still apply.</p>
