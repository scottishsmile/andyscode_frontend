# Website Update

I have just updated the API to .NET 8 and the website to NextJS v13.4.12

The biggest change for the API was implementing the new versioning system. Microsoft are no longer supporting API versioing "in house" and have farmed it off to a 3rd party team for .Net 8 onwards. So I had to install and configure Asp.Versioning.ApiExplorer

I don't want to go to NextJS v14 yet, as they have completely redesigned the structure of their project and it is still early days.
Version 13.4.12 was as far as I could go without breaking changes.
